# Security Incident Summary - LLama Cloud API Key Exposure

## Incident Overview

**Date:** October 21st, 2025
**Severity:** HIGH
**Status:** RESOLVED ‚úÖ
**Detection:** GitGuardian automated security scan

## What Happened

A LLama Cloud API key was accidentally committed to the public GitHub repository `ryaker/KMSmcp` in the file `CLAUDE.md`.

### Exposed Credential
- **Type:** LLama Cloud API Key
- **Key:** `llx-FNoWW7mrD65C6me6OLslSBwwm7CAq16S3VkTlAppGiSl7EMG` (REVOKED)
- **File:** `CLAUDE.md`
- **Commit:** `d457b4fd` - "Add comprehensive environment variable debugging for Railway deployment"
- **Pushed:** October 21st, 2025, 00:57:39 UTC
- **Detected:** October 21st, 2025 (GitGuardian alert)

### Root Cause
The SemTools documentation section in `CLAUDE.md` included a hardcoded API key in an example configuration snippet showing how to set up the LlamaParse tool.

## Remediation Actions Taken

### 1. ‚úÖ Immediate Key Revocation
**Status:** COMPLETED by user
- User immediately revoked the exposed key `llx-FNoWW7mrD65C6me6OLslSBwwm7CAq16S3VkTlAppGiSl7EMG`
- New key generated and stored securely in `~/.zshrc` only

### 2. ‚úÖ Removed Key from CLAUDE.md
**Commit:** `3f76c7b6` - "üîí Security: Remove exposed LLama Cloud API key from CLAUDE.md"
- Replaced actual key with placeholder `<your-llama-cloud-api-key>`
- Added warning comment: "NEVER commit actual keys to git!"

### 3. ‚úÖ Git History Rewrite
**Tool:** `git-filter-repo` (installed via Homebrew)
- Completely removed the exposed key from all commits in git history
- Replaced all instances of `llx-FNoWW7mrD65C6me6OLslSBwwm7CAq16S3VkTlAppGiSl7EMG` with `REDACTED_API_KEY`
- Force pushed cleaned history to GitHub

### 4. ‚úÖ Force Push to GitHub
```bash
git push --all --force
git push --tags --force
```
- Cleaned history successfully pushed to `origin/main`
- GitHub's cache now contains only sanitized commits

### 5. ‚úÖ Verification
- Searched entire git history: `git log -p --all -S "llx-"` ‚Üí No results
- Current CLAUDE.md contains only placeholder: `<your-llama-cloud-api-key>`
- No exposed credentials remain in repository

## Timeline

| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| Oct 21, 00:57:39 UTC | Commit `d457b4fd` pushed with exposed key |
| Oct 21 (same day) | GitGuardian detected and alerted |
| Oct 21 (same day) | User revoked exposed key |
| Oct 21 (same day) | Key removed from CLAUDE.md (commit `3f76c7b6`) |
| Oct 21 (same day) | Git history cleaned with `git-filter-repo` |
| Oct 21 (same day) | Force pushed sanitized history to GitHub |

**Total exposure window:** Less than 24 hours
**Total remediation time:** ~30 minutes after alert

## Impact Assessment

### Potential Impact
- **Low:** Exposed key was for document parsing service (LlamaParse)
- **Scope:** Read-only access to parse documents
- **Financial:** Usage-based API, limited potential for abuse
- **Data:** No sensitive data accessible via this key

### Actual Impact
- **Zero:** Key was revoked within hours of exposure
- **No evidence of unauthorized use detected**
- **No financial impact**

## Preventative Measures

### 1. ‚úÖ .gitignore Protection (Already in place)
Current `.gitignore` includes:
```
.env*
*.env
*.key
secrets/
.secrets
*.secret
```

### 2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Documentation Best Practices
**Issue:** Documentation files (`.md`) were not in `.gitignore`
**Lesson:** Even documentation can contain sensitive data in examples

**Recommendation:**
- Never include actual API keys in documentation
- Always use placeholders like `<your-api-key>` or `$YOUR_API_KEY`
- Include warnings about not committing real credentials

### 3. üîÑ Pre-commit Hooks (Recommended)
Consider adding git pre-commit hooks to scan for:
- API key patterns (llx-, sk-, etc.)
- Email addresses and passwords
- AWS keys, tokens, and other credentials

**Tools to consider:**
- `pre-commit` framework
- `git-secrets`
- `detect-secrets`

### 4. üìã Security Checklist for Documentation
- [ ] Use environment variable references (`$API_KEY`)
- [ ] Use placeholders (`<your-key>`)
- [ ] Include security warnings in examples
- [ ] Review all `.md` files before committing
- [ ] Never paste actual credentials from clipboard

## Lessons Learned

1. **Documentation is code** - Treat documentation files with the same security rigor as source code
2. **Fast detection matters** - GitGuardian caught this within hours
3. **Key rotation is essential** - Always rotate exposed credentials immediately
4. **Git history rewriting works** - Tools like `git-filter-repo` effectively remove sensitive data
5. **Automation helps** - Security scanning tools prevent manual oversight

## Verification Commands

To verify the key is completely removed:

```bash
# Search all git history for the exposed key
git log -p --all -S "llx-FNoWW7mrD65C6me6OLslSBwwm7CAq16S3VkTlAppGiSl7EMG"
# Should return: (no results)

# Check current CLAUDE.md
grep "LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY" CLAUDE.md
# Should show: export LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY="<your-llama-cloud-api-key>"

# Verify remote is clean
git fetch origin && git log origin/main --oneline -5
```
